  <p> These are my projects made with Photoshop, adobe, etc.</p>
  <h2>No-face Self Portrait</h2>
  <img src="No face project-Recovered.png" alt="No face self portrait" width="200" height="300">
  <p>This was made to show your identity without yourself in it. The benches are in Manhattan because that's where I'm from. The palm trees and beach are from the Philippines because that is my heritage. The person on the beach is one of my best friends, and the sky is from a balcony near my house.</p>
  <h2>Mood board project</h2>
  <img src="Mood board.png" alt="Mood board project" width="300" height="250">
  <p>The mood board project led up to the logo project. The mood board project was made to show how companies make things look appealing to the public. The logo was an extension of this. </p>

  <h2>Story telling project</h2>
  <img src= "Dusty Diongson - Photography_ Visual storytelling project.png" width= "275" height="250">
  <p>We used a mix of photography and storytelling for this. We picked a topic to tell a story about. I chose an intersection near my house. It's about how everything seems to stay the same but when you look back everything changes.</p>
